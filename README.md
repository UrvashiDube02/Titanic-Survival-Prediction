In this project, we delve into the world of machine learning to predict the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers based on a variety of factors such as age, gender, class, and more. By exploring this dataset and leveraging the power of predictive modelling, we aim to uncover insights into the determinants of survival during this historic disaster. Through the application of modern data science techniques, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced survival rates aboard the ill-fated Titanic, shedding light on the human stories behind the numbers. Join us on this journey as we navigate through the depths of data to unveil the secrets hidden within the Titanic's tragic tale.
